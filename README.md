## Purpose
Smoke tests are a suite of basic core functionality tests for Cloud Foundry.
They are suitable as an initial test against a new or updated deployment to
reveal fundamental problems with the system.

There are three tests in this suite, all of which are pretty simple:
1. `runtime`: Pushes an app and validates that HTTP requests are properly routed to the app.
2. `logging`: Pushes an app and validates that logs can be fetched for the app.
3. `isolation_segments`: Entitles an org to an isolation segment and pushes two apps,
  one to the isolation segment, and one to the shared segment.
  The test validates that isolated apps are only accessed via the isolated router,
  and that apps on the shared segment are only accessed via the shared router.

They are not intended to test more sophisticated functionality of Cloud Foundry
or to test administrator operations. The [CF Acceptance
Tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests) do perform this
more extensive testing, although they are designed to be run as part of a
development pipeline and not against production environments.

## Test Setup

### Dependencies

Set up your golang development environment, [per golang.org](http://golang.org/doc/install).

Make sure you have the following installed:
* [git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [`cf` CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)
* [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)

Check out a copy of `cf-smoke-tests` and make sure that it is added to your
`$GOPATH`.  The recommended way to do this is to run `go get -u -d
github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-smoke-tests`. You will receive a warning "no
buildable Go source files"; this can be ignored as there is no compilable go
code in the package.
(Alternatively, you can simply `cd` into the directory
and run `git pull`.)

To run the CF Smoke tests, you will need:
- a running CF instance
- an environment variable `$CONFIG` which points to a `.json` file that
contains the application domain

### Config

Below is an example `integration_config.json`:
```json
{
  "suite_name"                      : "CF_SMOKE_TESTS",
  "api"                             : "api.bosh-lite.com",
  "apps_domain"                     : "bosh-lite.com",
  "user"                            : "non-admin",
  "password"                        : "super-secure",
  "cleanup"                         : true,
  "logging_app"                     : "",
  "runtime_app"                     : "",
  "enable_windows_tests"            : false,
  "windows_stack"                   : "windows2012R2",
  "isolation_segment_name"          : "is1",
  "isolation_segment_domain"        : "is1.bosh-lite.com",
  "enable_isolation_segment_tests"  : true,
  "linux_buildpack_name"            : "binary_buildpack",
  "windows_buildpack_name"          : "hwc_buildpack"
}
```
The following are special case configurations.

#### Credentials
Must supply one of the following login credentials.

- User credentials
```json
  "user":     "username",
  "password": "password"
```
- Client credentials
```json
  "client":        "client-name",
  "client_secret": "client-secret"
```

#### Skip SSL validation
If you are running the tests against bosh-lite or any other environment using
self-signed certificates, add

```json
  "skip_ssl_validation": true
```
#### Org and space cleanup
If you would like to preserve the organization, space, and app created during the
tests for debugging, add

```json
  "cleanup": false
```
#### Windows

If you have deployed Windows cells, add

```json
  "enable_windows_tests": true,
  "windows_stack":        "windows2012R2"
```

The valid options for `windows_stack` are `windows2012R2` and `windows`.


If you'd like to run isolation segment tests, set `enable_isolation_segment_tests` to true and provide values for `isolation_segment_name`, `isolation_segment_domain`.
For more details on how to setup routing isolation segments, read this [document](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/routing-is.html).

#### Artifacts directory
To store cf cli trace output, set
```
  "artifacts_directory": "/tmp/smoke-artifacts"
```

The following files may be created:

```bash
CF-TRACE-Smoke-1.txt
CF-TRACE-Smoke-2.txt
junit-Applications-1.xml
...
```

#### Admin vs. Regular User
Smoke tests can be configured with
two types of users.

1. **Regular user**:
Smoke tests can be configured to run with a non-admin user.
If you'd like to use a non-admin user, it must be able to
assign user roles (either `OrgManager` or `SpaceManager`
roles). Please refer to the [Roles and Permissions for Active Orgs](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#roles-and-permissions-for-active-orgs)
documentation for more information.  In this configuration,
organization and space must be created ahead of time and
provided as `org` and `space` configuration properties,
respectively.  Also, `use_existing_org` and
`use_existing_space` must be set to `true`.  This
configuration is recommended for tests run against
environments run by humans, in particular, production
deployments.

2. **Admin user:**
Smoke tests can be configured to run using admin credentials.
Given this configuration,
the tests may or may not use existing resources like orgs and spaces,
because an admin user can easily create them.
This configuration is recommended for tests run against environments created using automation tools,
for example, CI (continuous integration) environments on development teams.

**NOTE:**
If you are enabling isolation segments tests and would like
to use a non-admin user, the existing organization provided
as `org` configuration property must be entitled to the
isolation segment provided by `isolation_segment_name`.
In addition, you need to create a space inside
`org` and provide it as `isolation_segment_space`.
`isolation_segment_space` must be assigned the isolation segment
`isolation_segment_name`.

have the following set up:
- The smoke-tests `org` must be entitled to use the isolation segment.
- The space that is referred to as `isolation_segment_space` in the smoke-tests config must be assigned to the isolation segment

**NOTE:**
If the default identity provider for your deployment is not UAA, it is
recommended that you set the `origin` configuration property to UAA, and ensure
the user credentials that you provide are registered with UAA.

## Running Tests

To execute the tests, run:

```bash
./bin/test
```

Internally the `bin/test` script runs tests using [ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo).

Arguments, such as `-focus=`, `-nodes=`, etc., that are passed to the script are sent to `ginkgo`

For example, to execute tests in parallel across two processes one would run:

```bash
./bin/test -nodes=2
```

### Seeing command-line output

To see verbose output from `cf`, use [ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)'s `-v` flag.

```bash
./bin/test -v
```

### Capturing CF CLI output

Set '`artifacts_directory`' in your `integration_config.json`.
to store cf cli trace output.
The output files will be saved inside the given
directory. See: [artifacts directory](#artifacts-directory)


## Contributing to Smoke Tests

### Guidelines
The goal of smoke tests
is to provide a small, simple set of tests
to verify basic deployment configuration.
As such, we have some guidelines
for contributing new tests to this suite.

#### Creating API resources in the test
One basic rule for good test design is not to mock the object under test.
We can translate that idea to a suite like smoke tests in the following way:
If smoke tests exist to validate deployment configuration,
then smoke tests should not itself mutate deployment configuration.

There are, however, several resources
that can be defined as either deployment configuration or as API resources.
For example, shared app domains and isolation segments
are both resources that can be created via the API,
so it might be tempting to have a test create them in a `BeforeSuite`.
However, shared app domains and isolation segments really represent deployment configurations.
Accordingly, smoke tests should not create those resources as part of the test;
instead, it should validate (either implicitly or explicitly)
that those resources have already been created, and configured correctly.

Other API resources, like orgs and spaces
that exist simply to be able to push an app,
can absolutely be created as part of a test.

#### Admin vs. Regular User workflows
Please refer to the [Regular vs admin user section](#admin-vs.-regular-user)
to understand the difference between these two workflows.

### Dependency Management

Smoke Tests use modules to manage `go` dependencies. These dependencies, together with the version of `go` itself, are automatically bumped by the CI pipeline defied in the [cf-smoke-tests-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-smoke-tests-release/tree/main/ci) repo.

All `go` packages required to run smoke tests are vendored into the `vendor/` directory.
